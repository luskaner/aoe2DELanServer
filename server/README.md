# Server

The server module represents the core of the LAN Server. It is a simple web server that listens to the game's
API requests. The server reimplements the minimum required API surface to allow the game to work in LAN mode.

## Minimum system requirements

#### Stable

- **Windows**: 7 or equivalent (10 or higher recommended).
- **Linux**: kernel 3.2 (5.10 or higher recommended, see [here](https://go.dev/wiki/Linux) for more details).
- **macOS**: Monterey v12 (Sonoma v14 or higher recommended).

Admin rights or firewall permission to listen on port 443 (https) will likely be required depending on the operating
system.

<details>
<summary>Experimental</summary>

- BSD-based (OpenBSD, DragonFly BSD, FreeBSD and NetBSD).
- Solaris-based (Solaris and Illumos).
- AIX.

Note: For the full list see [minimum requirements for Go](https://go.dev/wiki/MinimumRequirements) 1.27.

## Domains

### Main

* `aoe-api.reliclink.com`: legacy domain for AoE I: DE, AoE II: DE, AoE III: DE and AoE IV: AE.
* `*.worldsedgelink.com`: current domain for all games.

#### AoE 2: DE - Steam macOS

* `arthurlive-api.worldsedgelink.com`: exclusive domain.

### Playfab

* `*.playfabapi.com`: currently used in AoM for Arena of the Gods content.

### Partially proxied

- `api.ageofempires.com`: except text moderation so it works normally even without internet.
- `cdn.ageofempires.com`: except server status so it always shows online.

Note proxied domains only override part of the official functionality but retain the rest of it.

## Configuration

### Certificate

The easiest way to generate a self-signed certificate is by running the ``bin/genCert`` executable (more
info [here](../server-genCert) or you may leave
that to
the ```launcher``` if you are hosting and running the launcher on same PC.

#### Self-signed certificate

The self signed certificate pair (``selfsigned_cert.pem`` and ``selfsigned_key.pem``) is generated specifically for
non-AoM and non-AoE IV games.

#### Default

The default certificate pair (``cert.pem`` and ``key.pem``) serves as the default and for AoM and AoE IV. It is signed
by
`cacert.pem` certificate authority.

You can use your own certificate by (re)placing the `cert.pem` and `key.pem` files in the `resources/certificates`
directory.

### Main

The few configuration options are available in the [`config.toml`](resources/config/config.toml) file. The file is
self-explanatory and should be easy to understand.

### Login

The configuration file sent to the client upon login is `login.json` inside the game subdirectory in `resources/config`.
Some options
are
easy to understand while others might require researching.

### Cloud

The game connects to a static cloud to download assets. The server is configured to replace the original calls to
itself. The configuration file is `cloudfilesIndex.json` inside the game subdirectory in `resources/config` and the
corresponding
files reside in the [`cloud`](resources/responses/cloud) directory.

### Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition only

#### Chat Channels

The chat channels are defined in the [`chatChannels.json`](resources/config/age3/chatChannels.json) file.

### Other static responses

The server also serves some static responses for the game to work. The files are located in
the [`responses`](resources/responses) base directory.
